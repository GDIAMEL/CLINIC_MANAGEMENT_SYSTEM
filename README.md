# QUESTION ONE
## Build a Complete Database Management System
**Objective**

Design and implement a full-featured database using only MySQL.

**What to do**

1. Choose a real-world use case (e.g., Library Management, Student Records, Clinic Booking System, Inventory Tracking, etc.)
2. Create a well-structured relational database using SQL.

**Use SQL to create the following**

1. Tables with proper constraints (PK, FK, NOT NULL, UNIQUE)
2. Relationships (1-1, 1-M, M-M where needed)

**Deliverables**

A single .sql file containing your:

1. CREATE TABLE statements
2. SampleÂ  data

# Clinic Management System

A comprehensive database system for managing clinic operations including patients, doctors, services, appointments, and payments.

## Database Overview

The Clinic Management System database (`clinics_db`) is designed to efficiently handle the core operations of a medical clinic, including:

- Patient records management
- Doctor information and specialties
- Medical services offered
- Appointment scheduling and tracking
- Payment processing and records

## Database Schema

The database consists of 5 tables with the following relationships:

```

**Relationship Details:**

1. **Patients to Appointments** (One-to-Many)
   - A patient can schedule multiple appointments
   - Each appointment belongs to exactly one patient
   - Foreign key: `appointments.patient_id` references `patients.patient_id`

2. **Doctors to Appointments** (One-to-Many)
   - A doctor can conduct multiple appointments
   - Each appointment is conducted by exactly one doctor
   - Foreign key: `appointments.doctor_id` references `doctors.doctor_id`

3. **Services to Appointments** (One-to-Many)
   - A service can be included in multiple appointments
   - Each appointment involves exactly one service
   - Foreign key: `appointments.service_id` references `services.service_id`

4. **Appointments to Payments** (One-to-Many)
   - An appointment can generate multiple payments (e.g., installments)
   - Each payment is associated with exactly one appointment
   - Foreign key: `payments.appointment_id` references `appointments.appointment_id`

All relationships implement CASCADE DELETE to maintain referential integrity when parent records are removed.

## Relationships

- A patient can have multiple appointments
- A doctor can conduct multiple appointments
- A service can be included in multiple appointments
- An appointment can have multiple payments (e.g., partial payments)
- Each appointment is associated with exactly one patient, one doctor, and one service

## Sample Data

The database includes sample data for testing and demonstration purposes, including:
- 7 patients with diverse demographics
- 5 doctors with different specialties
- 5 medical services with varying costs
- 7 appointments scheduled for May 2025
- 7 corresponding payment records

## Usage Examples

### Finding all appointments for a specific patient

```sql
SELECT a.appointment_id, d.full_name AS doctor_name, s.service_name, 
       a.appointment_date, a.status
FROM appointments a
JOIN doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.doctor_id
JOIN services s ON a.service_id = s.service_id
WHERE a.patient_id = 1;
```

### Getting payment records for a specific time period

```sql
SELECT p.payment_id, pt.full_name AS patient_name, s.service_name, 
       p.amount_paid, p.payment_date
FROM payments p
JOIN appointments a ON p.appointment_id = a.appointment_id
JOIN patients pt ON a.patient_id = pt.patient_id
JOIN services s ON a.service_id = s.service_id
WHERE p.payment_date BETWEEN '2025-05-01' AND '2025-05-31';
```

### Finding available slots for a specific doctor

```sql
SELECT doctor_id, full_name
FROM doctors
WHERE doctor_id NOT IN (
    SELECT doctor_id
    FROM appointments
    WHERE appointment_date BETWEEN '2025-05-17' AND '2025-05-17 23:59:59'
);
```

## Installation

1. Ensure you have MySQL installed on your system
2. Run the SQL script to create the database structure:
   ```
   mysql -u username -p < clinic_management_system.sql
   ```
3. Verify the installation by connecting to the database:
   ```
   mysql -u username -p clinics_db
   ```

## Future Enhancements

- Add staff table for non-medical personnel
- Implement medical records tracking
- Add inventory management for medical supplies
- Create user permissions system for different staff roles
- Implement automated billing and insurance processing
